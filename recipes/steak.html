        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak – (Ribeye, Sirloin, Filet Mignon, or New York Strip) - 1-inch thick</li>
            <li>Salt – (Preferably coarse sea salt or kosher salt)</li>
            <li>Black Pepper – (Freshly ground for best flavor)</li>
            <li>Butter – (Unsalted, for basting)</li>
            <li>Garlic – (2-3 cloves, smashed or minced)</li>
            <li>Fresh Herbs – (Thyme, rosemary, or parsley for aromatics)</li>
            <li>Olive Oil – (Or another high smoke point oil like avocado oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Steak (30-40 minutes before cooking)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the steak out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature (important for even cooking).</li>
                <li>Pat it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture (helps in getting a good crust).</li>
                <li>Season generously on both sides with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Preheat the Pan (High Heat)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Place a cast iron skillet or a heavy pan on high heat for 3-5 minutes until it&rsquo;s smoking hot.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil (or another high smoke point oil) and swirl it around.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Sear the Steak (2-3 minutes per side)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully place the steak in the hot pan and do not move it for at least 2 minutes (this helps build a crust).</li>
                <li>Flip the steak using tongs after 2-3 minutes and sear the other side.</li>
                <li>Press it down lightly to ensure even contact with the pan.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Baste with Butter & Aromatics (Last 1-2 minutes)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
                <li>Add 2 tablespoons of butter, smashed garlic cloves, and fresh thyme or rosemary to the pan.</li>
                <li>Tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to continuously baste (scoop the melted butter and pour it over the steak) for about 1 minute per side.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Check Temperature for Doneness</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rare → 120-125°F (49-52°C)</li>
                    <li>Medium-Rare → 130-135°F (54-57°C)</li>
                    <li>Medium → 140-145°F (60-63°C)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Rest the Steak (5-10 minutes)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the steak from the pan and place it on a cutting board.</li>
                <li>Loosely cover with foil and let it rest for at least 5 minutes (this allows juices to redistribute).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Slice & Serve</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Slice the steak against the grain for maximum tenderness.</li>
                <li>Serve with your favorite side dishes (e.g., mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad).</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
